**Observations made from the data:**

--> **Weight (g)** is highly correlated to the **Avergae Tumor Volume (mm^3)** as the correlation coefficient between them is **0.84**.
--> From the box plot it can be clearly inferred that **'Infubinol'** has one outlier which has the **Tumor Volume** of **36.32 mm^3**.
--> In case of the mouse with **ID 'l509'** being treated with **'Capomulin'** drug, a gradual **decrease** in the **Tumor Volume** can be observed over the course of 45 days.
